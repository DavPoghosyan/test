# Hello World Java Project

This project is a simple "Hello, World!" Java application created to practice Git commands and workflow using GitHub. It serves as a test project to learn version control operations such as committing, branching, merging, and using pull requests.

## Purpose

- **Java Practice**: Write a basic Java program that outputs "Hello, World!" to the console.
- **Git Practice**: Experiment with essential Git commands and workflows:
  - Initializing repositories
  - Adding and committing changes
  - Creating branches and merging them
  - Using GitHub for pull requests and collaboration

git status        # Check the status of your repository
git add .         # Stage all changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"  # Commit with a message
git branch feature-branch       # Create a new branch
git checkout feature-branch     # Switch to the new branch
git merge feature-branch        # Merge feature branch into master
git push                        # Push changes to GitHub
